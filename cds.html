                        load
                        to be carried. Every group will be divided into two sub-groups and would be given the same

                        given 3 minutes to prepare for your lecturette. Topics may vary from "women empowerment",

                    </li>

                        meet together to discuss each candidate's performance and decide their final result. To remove
                        any doubt, you are called in, so that they can judge you one last time by asking a few
                        questions.
